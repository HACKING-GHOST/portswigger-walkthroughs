#Path -Traversal


   # Lab 1 :- File path traversal, simple case

      1.  We have to view the contents in the /etc/passwd file
      2.  Right click on any image.
      3.  Change the current image link ("https://YOUR_PROVIDED_IMAGE_ID.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=73.jpg") with this "https://YOUR_LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=../../../etc/passwd"
      4.  ../../../etc/passwd this is the addition we made in the URL to perform path traversal 
      5.  The sequence ../ is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from /var/www/images/ to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is: /etc/passwd
      6.  On Windows, both ../ and ..\ are valid directory traversal sequences
