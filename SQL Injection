#SQL Injection


      LAB - 1 : SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
      
      # Task 1 
      
         1.  We can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. We can submit:
             Single Quote Character ' ;  Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2 one every entry point present on application
             If the response back of the request shows us the Internal Server Error 
            
         2.  This lab contains vulnerability in its product category filter 
             Given to us : SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 
             We have to attack on it to make the application reveal one or more unreleased products 
      
         3.  This is the most basic type of SQL Injection based lab in this we can make the application reveal info with the most simple injection which is '+OR+1=1 in the URL
       
      LAB - 2 : SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
         
      # Task 1 
         
         1.  In this lab we have to bypass login page with existing SQLi vulnerability in login page 
             So we move out to login page at first where we we got username and password input fields 
             In which we can input SQLi parameters 
             
         2.  So we put administrator'-- in username as username is given to us and
             In password field we can put . and then click on log in and the login has bypassed 
      
      LAB - 3 : SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle
      
      # Task 1 
       
         1.  We have to query out the database type and version of Oracle in this lab using SQL Injection 
             As we know it is a Oracle database we will use banner and v$version in SQLi query to get the information 
             First we will determine how many columns are being returned on running the query , for that 
             https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=%27UNION%20SELECT%20%27abc%27%20,%20%27null%27%20FROM%20dual--
       
         2.  The database is quering out 2 columns so we will make a injection according to it which is
             https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/filter?category='UNION SELECT BANNER, NULL FROM v$version-- 
             This will give us the database version and the lab will be solved 
          
      LAB - 4 : SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft
          
      #  Task 1
           
         1.   In this lab we have to make the database query out DB type and version on MySQL and Microsoft 
              First we will check how much columns there are being returned, to check we can use ' order by 1-- which return 200 response means there is one column
              Then we use ' order by 2-- which also returns 200 , then on ' order by 3-- it shows error which means there are 2 columns

         2.   Now we will use a SQLi with union and also use the SQLi cheatsheet to get the database type which is ,
              ' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL-- -
