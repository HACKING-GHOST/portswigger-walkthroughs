#SQL Injection


      LAB - 1 : SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
      
      # Task 1 
      
         1.  We can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. We can submit:
             Single Quote Character ' ;  Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2 one every entry point present on application
             If the response back of the request shows us the Internal Server Error 
            
         2.  This lab contains vulnerability in its product category filter 
             Given to us : SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 
             We have to attack on it to make the application reveal one or more unreleased products 
      
         3.  This is the most basic type of SQL Injection based lab in this we can make the application reveal info with the most simple injection which is '+OR+1=1 in the URL
