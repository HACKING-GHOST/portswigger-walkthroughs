#Path -Traversal


   # Lab 1 :- File path traversal, simple case
     
      1.  We have to view the contents in the /etc/passwd file
      2.  Right click on any image.
      3.  Change the current image link ("https://YOUR_PROVIDED_IMAGE_ID.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=73.jpg") with this "https://YOUR_LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/image?filename=../../../etc/passwd"
      4.  ../../../etc/passwd this is the addition we made in the URL to perform path traversal 
      5.  The sequence ../ is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from /var/www/images/ to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is: /etc/passwd
      6.  On Windows, both ../ and ..\ are valid directory traversal sequences
     
   # Lab 2 :- File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
     
      1.  Absoulte Path = We might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as filename=/etc/passwd , to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequences.
      2.  Right click on any image.
      3.  Paste /etc/passwd in front of filename 
     
   # Lab 3 :- File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

      1.  Non-recursively stripping means removing directory traversal sequences or specified characters from a string or file path in a single pass, without using recursive function calls. This contrasts with recursively stripping, which would involve repeatedly removing these sequences until none are left.
      2.  This time we would add up sequence double because of stripping, ....//....//....//etc/passwd and this is to be injected in the URL

   # Lab 4 :- File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

      1. In this the URL would be first decoded and then would be stripped of and if written normal it would be obviously stripped off
      2. ../../../etc/passwd would be decoded two times to get ..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd

   # Lab 5 :- File path traversal, validation of start of path

      1. In this we have to go back into home first then go in /etc/passwd 
      2. Paste this in URL ../../../etc/passwd from here /var/www/images/

   # Lab 6 :- File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

      1. In this we have to use null byte to bypass ../../../etc/passwd this is the same traversal technique
      2. But this time we have to use null byte also so the parameter would add up ../../../etc/passwd%00.png It terminates the previous request written befoe null byte and only enables the .png to check through the URL 
      3. Where in the backend the parameter works as they were working in previous labs
