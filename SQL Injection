#SQL Injection


      LAB - 1 : SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
       
      
         1.  We can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. We can submit:
             Single Quote Character ' ;  Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2 one every entry point present on application
             If the response back of the request shows us the Internal Server Error 
            
         2.  This lab contains vulnerability in its product category filter 
             Given to us : SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 
             We have to attack on it to make the application reveal one or more unreleased products 
      
         3.  This is the most basic type of SQL Injection based lab in this we can make the application reveal info with the most simple injection which is '+OR+1=1 in the URL


      LAB - 2 : SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
         
         
         1.  In this lab we have to bypass login page with existing SQLi vulnerability in login page 
             So we move out to login page at first where we we got username and password input fields 
             In which we can input SQLi parameters 
             
         2.  So we put administrator'-- in username as username is given to us and
             In password field we can put . and then click on log in and the login has bypassed 


      LAB - 3 : SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle
      
       
         1.  We have to query out the database type and version of Oracle in this lab using SQL Injection 
             As we know it is a Oracle database we will use banner and v$version in SQLi query to get the information 
             First we will determine how many columns are being returned on running the query , for that 
             https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=%27UNION%20SELECT%20%27abc%27%20,%20%27null%27%20FROM%20dual--
       
         2.  The database is quering out 2 columns so we will make a injection according to it which is
             https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/filter?category='UNION SELECT BANNER, NULL FROM v$version-- 
             This will give us the database version and the lab will be solved 


      LAB - 4 : SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft
          
           
         1.   In this lab we have to make the database query out DB type and version on MySQL and Microsoft 
              First we will check how much columns there are being returned, to check we can use ' order by 1-- which return 200 response means there is one column
              Then we use ' order by 2-- which also returns 200 , then on ' order by 3-- it shows error which means there are 2 columns

         2.   Now we will use a SQLi with union and also use the SQLi cheatsheet to get the database type which is,
              ' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL-- - 


      LAB - 5 : SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases


          1.  In this lab we have to determine the table which contains usernames and passwords and the relevant columns 
              Output the content of the table and login in as administrator 
              First we will check the number of columns we have with ' order by 1-- ,which does not give any error we get error in ' order by 3-- means we have 2 columns 

          2.  Now we will find the version of the Database with ' union select @@version, NULL-- which give error means it is not the DB so to check another DB we wil go with another Injection which is ' union select version(), NULL--
              Which does not show any error means it is a postgreSQL DB , Now to get the table names in this database we will use ' union select table_name, NULL from information_schema.tables-- ,we have found table_name from google by searching about postgreSQL
              It shows us all the tables present in the DB from where we have to find out the one with users credentials information which we can find manually by searching table with users name 

          3.  After we got the table with user credentials we will find the column with credential in the table for which we will use ' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users_itdependsonyourlab'--
              After that we have got the columns with username(username_itdependsonyourlab) , password(password_itdependsonyourlab) Now we will query out the administrator's password with using 
              ' UNION SELECT username_itdependsonyourlab, password_itdependsonyourlab FROM users_itdependsonyourlab-- from here we will get the password for the administrator and the moment we do the login of the administrator we're done


        LAB - 6 : SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle 


          1.  In this lab we have to determine the table which contains usernames and passwords and the relevant columns 
              Output the content of the table and login in as administrator 
              First we will check the number of columns we have with ' order by 1-- ,which does not give any error we get error in ' order by 3-- means we have 2 columns 

          2.  Now we will find the version of the Database with ' union select @@version, NULL-- which give error means it is not the DB so to check another DB we wil go with another Injection which is ' union select banner, NULL FROM v$version--
              Which show's the version of the DB , Now to get the table names in this database we will use ' union select table_name, NULL from all_tables-- ,we have found table_name from google by searching about all_tables Oracle DB 
              It shows us all the tables present in the DB from where we have to find out the one with users credentials information which we can find manually by searching table with users name 

          3.  After we got the table with user credentials we will find the column with credential in the table for which we will use ' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users_itdependsonyourlab'--
              After that we have got the columns with username(username_itdependsonyourlab) , password(password_itdependsonyourlab) Now we will query out the administrator's password with using 
              ' UNION SELECT username_itdependsonyourlab, password_itdependsonyourlab FROM users_itdependsonyourlab-- from here we will get the password for the administrator and the moment we do the login of the administrator we're done


        LAB - 7 : SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query


          1.  In this lab we have to determine the number of columns returned by the query. For checking that we will use ' order by 1-- , ' order by 2-- , ' order by 3-- At ' order by 4-- it gives us internal server error which means there are 3 columns
              As we know now there are 3 columns so we will use ' Union select Null, Null, Null-- to return all columns in one time 
              

        LAB - 8 : SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text


          1.  In this lab we have to make the database retrieve a string provided by us on finding the column which contain text. First we have to check how many columns DB contains 
              For checking that we will use ' order by 1-- , ' order by 2-- , ' order by 3--,  At  ' order by 4-- it gives us internal server error which means there are 3 columns
              Now we will check which column contains text to check that we will use ' Union Select 'a', Null, Null-- , ' Union Select Null, 'a', Null-- , ' Union Select Null, Null, 'a'-- seperately to check which column contains text

          2.  And ' Union Select Null, 'a', Null-- is the query that gives us back 'a' outputted on the website which means it contains text. Now to make the database retrieve the string provided by the site to us we will use ' union select NULL, 'string', NULL-- and we're done


        LAB - 9 : SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables


          1.  In this lab we have to make the databse retrieve password of administrator which is stored in username, password column in users table. First we have to check how many columns does the lab return upon query and which DB does the lab contains 
              To check the columns we would use ' order by 1-- upto ' order by 3-- where it gives internal server error which means there are 2 columns now we will check the DB for that we will use all the queries from which this ' union select version(), NULL-- query return PostgreSQL DB version
              Now we will retrieve the password with the query ' union select username, password from users-- after that we will login into the account and we're done


        LAB - 10 : SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column


          1.  This lab contains different table called users, with columns called username and password we have to retrieve them and login . First we have to check how many columns DB contains 
              For checking that we will use ' order by 1-- , ' order by 2-- , At ' order by 3-- it gives us internal server error which means there are 2 columns in which 2nd column is the one which returns text we check that with 
              ' union select null, username from users-- from here we got 3 users where one of them is administrator then we tried ' union select null, passwords from users-- where we got 3 password so we tried all 3 passwords again & again with administrator as user and we login into the account and we're done


        LAB - 11 : Blind SQL injection with conditional responses


          1.  This lab contains a Blind SQLi vuln in category filter so we have to intercept the request by BurpSuite to get the administrator password with using intruder and brute-forcing it
